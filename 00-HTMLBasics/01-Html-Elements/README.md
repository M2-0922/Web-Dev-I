## Short historical part of WWW

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks. Hyperlinks connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. The first web browser was invented in `1990` by `Tim Berners-Lee`, and the first web page was created in 1991. The web browser was released outside of CERN in 1993, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

## HTML vs HTML5

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications.

Examples of HTML5 features are:

-   The new elements for structuring a page: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and so on.
-   The new input types, allowing to create user interfaces far more complex than those based on the traditional input type text.
-   Geolocation, which allows Web pages to access the location of the user.
-   Drag and drop, which simplifies creating advanced interfaces with drag and drop.
-   The video and audio elements, for playing audio and video directly in a Web page.



## Semantic HTML Elements

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML elements clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Why does Semantic HTML matter? Writing semantic HTML makes your code easier to understand, making the source code more readable for other developers. Screen readers and browsers can interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible. Semantic HTML is also SEO friendly.

Another example of semantic HTML is the use of the `<article>` element to wrap around blog posts, news articles, or any independent, self-contained content. This element clearly describes the meaning of the content. It is an article.

Another example of semantic HTML is the use of the `<nav>` element to wrap around a navigation section of a webpage. This element clearly describes the meaning of the content. It is a navigation section.

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Another example of semantic HTML is the use of the `<header>` element to wrap around a header section of a webpage. This element clearly describes the meaning of the content. It is a header section.

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>My website is the best website.</p>
</header>
```
- Article: The `<article>` tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
- Aside: The `<aside>` tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
- Details: The `<details>` tag specifies additional details that the user can view or hide on demand.
- Footer: The `<footer>` tag defines a footer for a document or section.
- Header: The `<header>` tag defines a header for a document or section.
- Main: The `<main>` element is used to denote the content of a webpage that relates to the central topic of that page or application. It should include content that is unique to that page and should not include content that is duplicated across multiple webpages, such as headers, footers, and primary navigation elements.
- Mark: The `<mark>` tag defines marked/highlighted text.
- Nav: The `<nav>` tag defines a set of navigation links.
- Section: The `<section>` tag defines a section in a document.
- Summary: The `<summary>` tag defines a visible heading for the `<details>` element.

## Block-level Elements
