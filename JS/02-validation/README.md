Validation is the process of ensuring that data entered into a form or other input field is in the correct format and meets certain criteria (e.g. is a valid email address or is a number within a certain range). Cross-browser compatibility refers to the ability of a website or web application to function correctly in different web browsers.

In order to ensure that a form or other input is properly validated and the website or application is cross-browser compatible, there are a few best practices to follow:

- Use server-side validation in addition to client-side validation. Server-side validation is performed on the server and can catch any errors that might be missed by client-side validation (which is performed in the user's web browser).

- Use modern, standards-compliant HTML and CSS. This will help ensure that your website or application works correctly across different browsers and devices.

- Use feature detection rather than browser detection. Feature detection involves checking for the presence of specific features (e.g. support for a particular CSS property) rather than checking for a specific browser. This is more reliable and ensures that your website or application will work correctly in future versions of browsers.

- Test your website or application in multiple browsers and devices. This will help you identify and fix any issues that might arise due to differences in browser implementations.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your website or application is properly validated and has good cross-browser compatibility.

###### Example

```js
function validateForm() {
  // Get form element
  const form = document.getElementById('my-form');

  // Get input elements
  const nameInput = document.getElementById('name');
  const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
  const passwordInput = document.getElementById('password');

  // Validate name
  if (nameInput.value.length < 3) {
    alert('Name must be at least 3 characters long');
    nameInput.focus();
    return false;
  }

  // Validate email
  if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(emailInput.value)) {
    alert('Please enter a valid email address');
    emailInput.focus();
    return false;
  }

  // Validate password
  if (passwordInput.value.length < 8) {
    alert('Password must be at least 8 characters long');
    passwordInput.focus();
    return false;
  }

  // If all validations pass, submit the form
  form.submit();
}
```

This function performs several checks on the form's input fields:

- It checks that the name input is at least 3 characters long.
- It checks that the email input is a valid email address using a regular expression.
- It checks that the password input is at least 8 characters long.

If any of these checks fail, an alert message is shown and the focus is set to the invalid input field. If all checks pass, the form is submitted.

To use this function, you would need to add it to your JavaScript code and then attach it to the form's submit event. For example:

```html
<form id="my-form" onsubmit="return validateForm()">
  <!-- Form fields go here -->
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

This will cause the form to be validated when the submit button is clicked. If the form is valid, the function will return true and the form will be submitted. If the form is invalid, the function will return false and the form submission will be canceled.
