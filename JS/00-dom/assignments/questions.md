###### Question 1:

Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as an argument and appends it as a new paragraph to the body of a page. The function should create a new p element, set its text content to the string argument, and then append it to the body of the page.

###### Question 2:

Write a JavaScript function that changes the background color of a page to a randomly generated color when a button is clicked. The function should select the button element and attach a click event listener to it. When the button is clicked, the function should get the body element, generate a random color string (e.g. '#ff00cc'), and set the body element's backgroundColor style to the random color.

###### Question 3:

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of objects as an argument and generates an HTML table from the objects. Each object should represent a row in the table, with the object's properties corresponding to the columns. The function should create a table element, add a row for each object, and then add a cell for each object property. The function should then append the table to the body of the page.
